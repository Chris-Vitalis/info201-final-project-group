# INFO 201 Final Project Proposal: Youtube's API
By: Chris Vitalis, Yeh-Sun Lee, Alvin Tran, JoJo Saunders
## Project Description
The goal of this project is to work with the [Youtube API](link) and the [World Demographic API](link) to be able to understand the







## Technical Description
**How will We Be Reading in Our Data?**

We will be using both Youtube's API and an API on Country population in order to be able to understand both the demographics of the countries but how they also link up to Youtube Creator's subscriber Demographics.

**What Type of Data Wrangling Will Need to Do?**

We'll need to find the data frames of relevant information, pertaining to a Creator's subscriber gender demographic, age demographic, and location demographic to be able to match it to the overall demographic of the country itself. These values can be stored in csv files but can be read in to do data analysis and visualization.

**What Libraries Will Be Used for this Project?**

We'll require the use of the _dplyr_ library for data wrangling, _ggplot2_ and _plotly_ for data visualization. We will also be using _shiny_ to help more with the construction of our final website, and more visualization uses. Other than those, we are currently looking at other libraries to further help with data visualizations.

**What Major Challenges Do You Anticipate?**

One of the biggest challenges we'll face will be trying to analyze the information from Youtube's API into a manageable data frame in order to both visualize the data but also connect it to the world demographic's API, while also being able to display all the relevant information required to answer our questions. The data presented by Youtube is big scale data, so being able to filter down and create a dataset that will be useful, and easily understood will most likely be the most difficult aspect of the project.
